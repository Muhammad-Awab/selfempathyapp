TODO:

- Set up router paths
Index: accept query params
/process : take index query param and e.target.value to generate page content.

Page one:
- Refactor page into components. Pass state as needed into components.

- Add query param to <Select /> to include &section=complaints &section=feelings
- add onClick functionality to navigate from div to page two
- add + div at end of list

Page two:
- use react router to pass section state to page two (for back button UX consistency)
