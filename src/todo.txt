TODO:
- Implement EFSummary component. Display all selected values.




Page one:
- IMG handling: switch from img src paths to import statements. All svg links are broken on deploy.
- Add query param to <Select /> to include &section=complaints &section=feelings
- add + div at end of list
- Add "neglegent" to complaints list

Page two:
- use react router to pass section state to page two (for back button UX consistency)
