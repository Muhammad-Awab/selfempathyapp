TODO:

- Pull selected state up to EmpathyForm level
- State needs to persist between each form AND be able to count toward upvote





Page one:
- Add query param to <Select /> to include &section=complaints &section=feelings
- add + div at end of list
- Add "neglegent" to complaints list

Page two:
- use react router to pass section state to page two (for back button UX consistency)
