TODO:
- Pull selected state up to EmpathyForm level
- State needs to persist between each form AND be able to count toward upvote
- Implement EFSummary component. Display all selected values.




Page one:
- BUG FIX: input needs to default to lower case (search does not catch uppercase values) or, change filter function to account for upper and lower case.
- IMG handling: switch from img src paths to import statements. All svg links are broken on deploy.
- Add query param to <Select /> to include &section=complaints &section=feelings
- add + div at end of list
- Add "neglegent" to complaints list

Page two:
- use react router to pass section state to page two (for back button UX consistency)
