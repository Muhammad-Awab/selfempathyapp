TODO:
const formPage = step.type.name does NOT work becuase it is using the file name on the dev environment.
Figure out how to query this in the build environment.


Page one:
- Add query param to <Select /> to include &section=complaints &section=feelings
- add + div at end of list
- Add "neglegent" to complaints list

Page two:
- use react router to pass section state to page two (for back button UX consistency)
